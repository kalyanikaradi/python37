# Machine Learning (ML) is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI)
# that focuses on the development of algorithms and models that enable 
# computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed for specific tasks.
# In other words, ML allows machines to automatically improve their performance on a given task as they are exposed to more data over time.


# In[2]:


# There are three main types of machine learning:

# Supervised Learning: In this type of learning, the algorithm is trained on a labeled dataset, where the input data is paired with the corresponding desired output.
#     The goal is for the algorithm to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs, allowing it to make predictions or classifications on new, unseen data.

# Unsupervised Learning: Unlike supervised learning, unsupervised learning deals with unlabeled data.
    
#     The algorithm tries to find patterns or relationships within the data without explicit guidance on what the output should be.
#     Common tasks in unsupervised learning include clustering and dimensionality reduction.

# Reinforcement Learning: This type of learning involves an agent that learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment. The agent receives feedback in the form of rewards or punishments based on the actions it takes. 
#     The goal is for the agent to learn a policy that maximizes cumulative rewards over time.

# Some popular machine learning algorithms include:

# Linear Regression: Used for predicting a continuous output based on one or more input features.

# Decision Trees and Random Forests: Decision trees are used for classification and regression tasks. Random Forests are an ensemble of decision trees.

# Support Vector Machines (SVM): Used for both classification and regression tasks by finding a hyperplane that best separates the data into different classes.

# Neural Networks: Inspired by the structure and function of the human brain, neural networks are a set of algorithms designed to recognize patterns.

# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): A simple algorithm used for classification and regression tasks based on the majority class or average of the k-nearest data points.

# Supervised Learning:
# Definition: In supervised learning, the algorithm is trained on a labeled dataset, where each training example consists of input data and its corresponding output (label).

# Objective: The primary goal is to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs, enabling the algorithm to make accurate predictions or classifications on new, unseen data.

# Types:

# Classification: The output is a category label, and the algorithm learns to assign input data to predefined categories. Examples include spam detection or image classification.

# Regression: The output is a continuous value, and the algorithm learns to predict numerical values. Examples include predicting house prices or stock prices.

# Example Algorithms:

# Logistic Regression
# Support Vector Machines (SVM)
# Decision Trees
# Random Forest
# Neural Networks

# Unsupervised Learning:
# Definition: In unsupervised learning, the algorithm is given unlabeled data and must find patterns, relationships, or structure within the data without explicit guidance.

# Objective: Common tasks include clustering similar data points together or reducing the dimensionality of the data.

# Types:

# Clustering: Grouping similar data points together based on some criteria. Examples include customer segmentation or document clustering.

# Dimensionality Reduction: Reducing the number of features in the dataset while preserving its essential information. Examples include Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE).

# Association: Discovering relationships between variables in large datasets. Examples include market basket analysis in retail.

# Example Algorithms:

# K-Means Clustering
# Hierarchical Clustering
# Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
# Independent Component Analysis (ICA)
# Apriori Algorithm for association rule learning
